# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-06)

**Core value:** Members can manage their association membership, track continuing education credits, and stay current on dues — from any device, with minimal friction.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — Data Model Unification

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 03
Last activity: 2026-05-06

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 22%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 8.5m
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2/2 | 17m | 8.5m |
| 02 | 3 | - | - |
| 03 | 3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 12m, 5m
- Trend: accelerating

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02-audit-module-completion P01 | 5m | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 02-audit-module-completion P02 | 8m | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 02-audit-module-completion P03 | 5m | 1 task | 1 file |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Test current dual model, unify later (safety net before migration)
- TypeSpec reconciliation after unification (need canonical schema first)
- Used customerOrMerchant OR-filter in repo for non-admin list scoping
- Fixed lint-staged to use bunx + workspace eslint configs (was broken)
- Used makeCtx + stubRepo pattern for billing tests (matches project test standard)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Dual data model (custom vs TypeSpec) adds complexity to test retrofit — tests must cover both models before unification
- 7 missing BR test cases (33/40) need identification and implementation
